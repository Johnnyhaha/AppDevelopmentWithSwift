/*:
 **Lab - Type Casting**
 
 Create a collection of type [Any], including a few doubles, integers, strings, and booleans within the collection. Print the contents of the collection.
 */


/*:
 Loop through the collection and total up the number of elements of each type. Print which type was most common within your collection, and how many there were.
 */


/*:
 Create a [String : Any] dictionary, where the values are a mixture of doubles, integers, strings, and booleans. Print the key/value pairs within the collection
 */


/*:
 Loop through the dictionary, and total up the integers and doubles. For each string value, add 1 to the total. For each boolean, add 2 to the total if the boolean is `true`, or subtract 3 if it's `false`.
 */

/*:
 Loop through the collection again, adding up all the integers and doubles. For each string that you come across during the loop, attempt to convert the string into a number, and add that value to the total. Print the total.
