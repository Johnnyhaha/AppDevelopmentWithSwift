 ## Exercise - Control Transfer Statements
 
 Create a for-in loop that will loop through the characters of `alphabet`, and print every other letter by continuing to the next iteration if you are on a letter you do not wish to print. (Hint: You can use the modulo operator to only print even indexed characters).

 Create a `[String: String]` dictionary where the keys are names of states and the values are their capitals. Include at least three key/value pairs in your collection, with one of them being your home state. Now loop through this dictionary again, printing out the keys and values in a sentence, but add an if statement that will check if the current iteration is your home state. If it is, print("I found my home!") and break out of the loop.
